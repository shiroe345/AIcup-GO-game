# Introduction
There are 3 AI models required to train in this contest, namely Dan, Kyu, and Play Style models. The baseline models are trained by using TensorFlow 2.9 and shared in this repository. 

# File Structure
  - **CSVs**: Dataset folder for training and testing
  - **Dan Training Tutorial.ipynb**: Baseline model training of Dan dataset
  - **Kyu Training Tutorial.ipynb**: Baseline model training of Kyu dataset
  - **PlayStyle Training Tutorial.ipynb**: Baseline model training of PlayStyle dataset
  - **Create Public Upload CSV.ipynb**: Predictions by using the baseline models
  - **model_dan_tutorial.h5**: Baseline model of Dan dataset
  - **model_kyu_tutorial.h5**: Baseline model of Kyu dataset
  - **model_playstyle_tutorial.h5**: Baseline model of PlayStyle dataset
  - **public_submission_template**: Predictions for public testing datasets

To generate the baseline models, you can follow tutorial notebooks.

For submission, you can follow **Create Public Upload CSV.ipynb** notebook.
# Note
Because the training data and test data too large, we only provide tutorial training and test data
