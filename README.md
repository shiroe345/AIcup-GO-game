# Introduction
There are 3 AI models required to train in this contest, namely Dan, Kyu, and Play Style models. Our goal is to predict the next step and the style of each GO-game.

# File Structure
  - **CSVs**: Dataset folder for training and testing
  - **Dan Training Tutorial.ipynb**: The model training of Dan dataset
  - **Kyu Training Tutorial.ipynb**: The model training of Kyu dataset
  - **PlayStyle Training Tutorial.ipynb**: The model training of PlayStyle dataset
  - **Create Public Upload CSV.ipynb**: Predictions by using the models above
  - **public_submission_template**: Predictions for public testing datasets


For submission, you can follow **Create Public Upload CSV.ipynb** notebook.
# Note
Because the training data and test data too large, we only provide tutorial training and test data.
